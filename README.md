A lightweight CMS for my personal website

## Aims and Goals

I want to stop using Wordpress for my website. Instead, I'd
like to have a small lightweight CMS that serves a static HTML website.

Goals:

- [ ] Be able to define the entire website simply with text flies
- [ ] Be able to add blog posts by simply adding files
- [ ] Website should be generated automatically when filesystem is changed
- [ ] Website should look very minimalistic, yet aesthetically pleasing
- [ ] The entire website should be generated into a single HTML file (excluding binary assets)
