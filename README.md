A simple CMS for creating small, lightweight personal websites

## Aim of the project

I want to stop using Wordpress for my website. Instead, I'd
like to have a small lightweight CMS that serves a static HTML website.

## Roadmaps

Roadmap to V1.0.0!

- [x] Be able to define the entire website simply with text flies
- [x] Be able to add blog posts by simply adding files
- [x] Website should be generated automatically when filesystem is changed
- [x] Website should look very minimalistic, yet aesthetically pleasing
- [x] The entire website should be generated into a single HTML file (excluding binary assets)

Roadmap to V1.1.0!

- [ ] Add server functionality so that the source files can be modified and previewed on-the-fly
